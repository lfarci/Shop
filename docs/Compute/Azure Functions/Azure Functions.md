You can apply the approaches you've learned here to add and test bindings in your functions. Here are a few interesting ideas to get more practice with bindings and to build on what you have learned here.

- Create another function to read from Blob storage and other input bindings that we haven't used in this module.
    
- Create another function to write to more destinations by using other supported output binding types.
    
- In the preceding unit, we introduced a queue and posted messages to it with an output binding. As a next step, consider adding another function that reads the messages in the queue and prints the **MESSAGE TEXT** to the console with `console.log()`.
